# Browsers supporting modern TLS standards on Mac OS X 10.4/10.5

Many present day websites reject browsers that do not support new TLS standards. Forunately, some people built new browsers to solve this problem:

- [TenFourFox](https://www.floodgap.com/software/tenfourfox/)

Expect many websites to be running slow unless JavaScript is disabled.

# Linux distributions

It is easier to get modern software running on Linux compared to that of era Mac OS X.

Some active Linux distributions:
- [Lubuntu 16.04/12.04 remix](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lubuntu-16-04-remix-updated.2204742/)
- [Void Linux ppc](https://voidlinux-ppc.org)

Note that kernel parameters fiddling might be required to make the display work correctly.
Some software might exhibit bugs due to big endian.

# Communities

There are communities that are still actively using PowerPC Macs. Here are some that I participate:
