# BeOS
Before Be the company closed its doors in 2001, BeOS targeted x86 processors ranging from Intel Pentium to Intel Pentium III (and similar processors from other vendors).
BeOS enthusiasts extended BeOS's life for a few more years with drivers and apps.

Find some of the BeOS goodies [here](http://pulkomandy.tk/~beosarchive/).

CD-ROM images of BeOS editions can be found in archive sites.
The CD-ROM images are bootable.

# Haiku
[Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org) is an open-source continuation of BeOS.

As a rule of thumb, if your computer's main board has no IDE port then Haiku is the only choice.

Note that Haiku's RAM requirement is much higher compared to that of BeOS;
512M is probably the minimum.

# Data Exchange
Haiku can write to BFS partitions created by BeOS x86.
